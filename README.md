# Unlister

Unlister is a web app that you can use to see if a playlist or a list of YouTube video URLs
references a video marked **Unlisted**, i.e., only visible to users that a link to the video.
That way, you can quickly take action on those unlisted videos [before YouTube makes them private on July 23, 2021](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/update-youtube-unlisted-links/).

Check out a live version of this web app and take action on your favorite unlisted videos [here](https://app.rclim95.com/unlister)!

Special thanks to [Sethycakes](https://www.github.com/Sethycakes) for this idea (and requesting it
in the first place)! ðŸ˜Š
